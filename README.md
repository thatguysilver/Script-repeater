# (script repeater)

Vim users! Are you tooo lazy to reach for the arrow keys and/or exclamation point to test extremely simple scripts? If so, Script-repeater is for you!

Basically, it runs a bash command every n seconds. Intended use is for testing extremely simple scripts while learning a new language, etc.

Currently supports .html, .rs (only using Cargo) and .py.

1. **Make executable:**

while in directory:

$ chmod +x rept.py"

2. **Use it by typing the following format:**

$ ./rept.py \<path> \<interval>

where interval is in seconds.
